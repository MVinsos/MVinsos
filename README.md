### Hey.

---

My career began in the banking sector and in an insurance brokerage, where I developed proactivity, adaptability, and the ability to handle diverse responsibilities.

I hold a degree in Financial Management and have completed technical courses in Web Design and Administration, along with several complementary courses. I have an intermediate-to-advanced level of English and continue developing my skills.

Currently, I am focused on front-end development while advancing in back-end skills, aiming to work as a full-stack developer. I am continuously learning and applying my knowledge in practical projects to solidify my transition into the technology field.
